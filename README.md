Group Project 3
===============================
# Overview

For this group project students will work to write a full stack web application. This will incorporate everything we learned in the classroom. Students will be given tasks across the full stack to ensure everyone works on all pieces of the application. The application will be managed in a simulated kan ban agile style and will make use of Github issues and the project board features. During the first day of the project students will go through the ERD and wireframe that the stakeholders had a account lead put together for you. From these each team will need to create their own endpoint documentation and add it to the wiki. Once that's done each team should meet with their lead and plan out the project by creating issues and assigning each member their first 2-3 tasks. The target for the week is to finish a minimum viable producte of their application with as many features complete as possible and functional prototype to present to the full FT team and others from Cook Systems internal staff. All teams will have a cut-off time of 12pm CT the last Thursday of class. At that point they should begin putting together their presentation and practice it with their lead a minimum of 2 times that afternoon. The final Friday all teams will present that applications.
